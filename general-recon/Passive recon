# Passive Reconnaissance
Passive reconnaissance involves gathering information about a target without directly interacting with the target systems or networks. This means no packets, probes, or requests are sent to the victimâ€™s infrastructure. Instead, data is collected from publicly available sources such as DNS records, public databases, search engines, social media, certificate transparency logs, and leaked credentials.
This approach is stealthy and low-risk, as it leaves no trace on the target and is often the first step in the information gathering phase of a penetration test or security assessment.
