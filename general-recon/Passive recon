# Passive Reconnaissance
Passive reconnaissance involves gathering information about a target without directly interacting with the target systems or networks. This means no packets, probes, or requests are sent to the victimâ€™s infrastructure. Instead, data is collected from publicly available sources such as DNS records, public databases, search engines, social media, certificate transparency logs, and leaked credentials.
This approach is stealthy and low-risk, as it leaves no trace on the target and is often the first step in the information gathering phase of a penetration test or security assessment.
whois example.com

dig example.com ANY

nslookup -type=MX example.com

curl "https://api.hunter.io/v2/domain-search?domain=example.com&api_key=YOUR_API_KEY" (API call to third party, no direct target interaction)

https://haveibeenpwned.com/unifiedsearch/example@example.com (web query to third party)

theharvester -d example.com -b all (passive data collection from public sources)

recon-ng modules that use public search engines (e.g., bing_domain_web)

shodan search apache (searching Shodan's database, no scanning done by you)

sublist3r -d example.com -o subdomains.txt (uses passive DNS data and search engines)

amass enum -d example.com -o amass_subdomains.txt (when run in passive mode; Amass can do active too but default enumeration is mostly passive)

https://crt.sh/?q=%25.example.com (certificate transparency logs query)
